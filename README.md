Project: Accounting for possible endosymbiont contamination in bed bug sequences
 

It is relevant to my current lab's research for three main reasons. One, bed bugs are important human ectoparasites that have high insecticide 
resistance. One possible control method could be centered around an endosymbiont known as Wolbachia. It has been noted in bed bugs since 
1921 (Arkwright) and is present in 83-100% of sampled populations (Sakamoto and Rasgon 2006). It was also identified by PCR in the cliff swallow
bug, Cimex vicarius (Rasgon and Scott 2004). Two, wolbachia is found in a diverse range of of invertebrates (Sakamoto and Rasgon 2019), 
extending the implications of this research to multiple clades. Three, most insects likely have multiple bacterial endosymbionts living 
within them and many labs are beginning to work with ddRAD reads. However, there isn't a current method of detecting how much contamination 
comes from endosymbiont genomes. This project seeks to determine if we need to account for endosymbiont DNA in ddRAD studies of insects
